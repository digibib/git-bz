This version of git-bz has been customized for use by the Koha project.
In particular, the following changes have been made compared to the "regular"
git-bz available elsewhere:
1) The authentication code now plays nicely with the Bugzilla instance on
   bugs.koha-community.org
2) Patches are applied using a 3-way merge
3) The ability to update bug statuses to those statuses used by the Koha
   project has been added
4) It is possible to respond 'a' when asked about applying patches to apply
   all remaining patches
5) A -m/--mail option will send patches to the koha-patches mailing list when
   attaching them to bugs
6) A -s/--signoff option will sign off on patches as they are being applied
   (NOTE THAT THIS OPTION IS INTENDED FOR USE WHEN PUSHING BRANCHES. DO
    NOT USE THIS OPTION AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ACTUALLY TESTING CODE.)
